# Unicycle-Navigation V2 - Multiple Robots

This is a complimentary README to the original README file. It will go over the changes that were made according to the task at hand:
1. Support multiple independent robots each one moving towards the goal.
2. Each robot should start at a random location.
3. The number of obstacles should be up to 3.
4. Extra: The robots should avoid colliding with each other.

## Multiple robot support
The initial implementation regarded a single robot, and all calculations were directly performed on specified variables that held the robots data.
In Order to support multiple robots, the `robot_list = create_robots(num_robots, game.data)` 
performed the creation of robots by the amount specified in the argument `num_robots = 3` inside `app.config.config.py`.
From this point forward, the same logic was maintained as before, but now every time there is a reference or an operation on the robot `bot` - 
it is done through the loop over each `bot` in `robot_list`.
Moreover, the manipulation of data is done per each bot individually rather than using the previous `robot_X`, 
now each robot maintains its own data as can accessed through `bot.x`.
For this reason, the `update_position(self, v, omega)` was added to the `Robot` class in order to maintain its values.

## Random start location
Inside the `app.controllers.robot_controller.py` the function `create_robots(num_robots, data)` loops over and creates the robots. 
Each iteration a new `Robot` is declared with random x/y/phi variables.
```
robot_x = random.randint(0, screen_width)
robot_y = random.randint(0, screen_height)
robot_phi = random.uniform(0, 2 * np.pi)
```
The x/y coordinates are generated using the `random.randint(self, a:int, b:int)` in order to output a random int inside the screen.  
The phi degree is generated using the `random.uniform(self, a:float, b:float)` between the range of 0 - 360 (0 - 2Ï€).

## Up to 3 obstacles
The number of obstacles is configured in the `app.config.config.py` file as `num_circ_obsts = 3`.

## Robots should avoid colliding with each other
The logic of the robots movement is performed in the function `calculate_movement(bot, robot_list, circ_x, circ_y, radius)` inside the `app.controllers.robot_controller.py`.
The robot first checks if it is near any obstacles in its radius `skirt_r` in the function `close_obst_count(bot, num_circ_obsts, circ_x, circ_y, radius)`.
If there aren't any, the robot generates its `v, omega` from `go_to_goal()`.
If there is an obstacle close by, the values will be generated from `avoid(self, obstX)`.
Last, the robot will calculate its distance from other robots. If another robots radius is within its own radius, the robot will use the 
same `avoid(self, obstX)` but now with the other robot as `obstX` and calculate the same 'paranoid' `v, omega`.
This means that the priority of the robot is to avoid other robots. More specifically the priority order is:
1. avoid other robots
2. avoid obstacles
3. go to goal

## System architecture and structure
In the initial system, the entire code except for the `Robot` class was inside the `main.py` file.
In this V2 the system is divided into multiple parts with independent functionality.
- `app` Directory - Holds all of the app code.
  - `main.py` contains the "View" control of the system. All logic, calculations and classes were removed. The file contains
  only initializations and calls to functions, and is in charge of manipulating the GUI of the system.
  - `entities` Directory - The directory holds the classes and entities of the system
    - `robot.py` - The Robot class, with and addition of `update_position(self, v, omega)`.
    - `circular_obsts.py` - Same as before but in its own separate file.
  - `config` Directory - Global variables and configuration aspects of the system. 
    - `config.py` - Provides the ability to change variables in the system out of one single place.
    - `init.py` - Initialization of the `pygame` package.
    - `game.py` - Holds the Game class which contains data on the GUI and the game objects.
  - `controllers` Directory - Controllers hold the logic calculation and manipulation of the objects.
    - `robot_controller.py` - Manipulation and calculations on the Robot object can be done through the methods in the controller.
- `docs` Directory - System documentation.
  - `LICENSE`
  - `README.md`
  - `V2_README.md`
- `resources` Directory - Same as before.
